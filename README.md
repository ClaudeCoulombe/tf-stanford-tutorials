This repository contains the code example for a Chatbot from the course CS 20SI: TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research at Stanford University<br>

A neural chatbot using sequence to sequence model with attentional decoder in TensorFlow. Originally it was created by Chip Huyen as the starter code for an assignment «TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research» cs20si.stanford.edu﻿

Claude Coulombe (PhD candidate Téluq / UQAM) updated the code in order to be compatible wit h Python 3 and TensorFlow 1.1. On May 31 2017, it seems to work correctly but have not the computing ressources to train it for a long period of time.<br>
