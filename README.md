# tf-stanford-tutorials Chatbot
This repository contains the code example for a Chatbot from the course CS 20SI: TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research at Stanford University<br>
I've updated the code in order to be compatible wit h Python 3 and TensorFlow 1.1'<br>

Detailed syllabus and lecture notes can be found here http://cs20si.stanford.edu
